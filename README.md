This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


This project is a web application that was built using Next.js, a popular React-based web framework. With Next.js, the application benefits from server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other performance optimizations.

The project also leverages Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid prototyping and customization. With Tailwind, developers can create responsive and mobile-first layouts with ease.

Furthermore, this application includes parallax scrolling, an effect that creates an illusion of depth and perspective by moving background and foreground elements at different speeds. Parallax scrolling adds a touch of interactivity and creativity to the user experience.

In summary, this web application showcases the power and flexibility of Next.js, the ease and versatility of Tailwind CSS, and the visual appeal of parallax scrolling.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
